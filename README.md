**C-STRUCTURE: Empowering Students with Efficient Data Structures in C**

---

A comprehensive collection of header files of 'C' language  focusing on the data-structures started by [@Fatin Shadab](https://github.com/FatinShadab) maintained by [@UIU Developers Hub](https://github.com/UIU-Developers-Hub)

---

Welcome to C-STRUCTURE, your go-to repository for mastering data structures in C. Here, we provide meticulously crafted header files, starting with our flagship implementation: the Singly Linked List (SLL). As an open-source contribution hub, this repository serves as a foundation for various data structure implementations, helping developers enhance their skills and contribute to the coding community.

**Header Files**
-  [**sll.h** ](https://github.com/UIU-Developers-Hub/C-STRUCTURE/tree/main/SLL) : Implementation of 'Single Linked List'
-  [**dll.h** ](https://github.com/UIU-Developers-Hub/C-STRUCTURE/tree/main/DLL) : Implementation of 'Doubly Linked List'


**Features**
  
- **Modular Design**: Each header file is designed with modularity in mind, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate different data structures into their projects.

- **Open Source**: Contribute your own implementations of data structures in C and collaborate with a vibrant community of developers.

- **Educational Resource**: Whether you're a beginner learning the basics or an experienced programmer looking to sharpen your skills, our repository offers valuable insights into data structure implementation and manipulation.
